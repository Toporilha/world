The baked-in fields for specific product keys seemed a waste of screen real estate and confirms that the program s product key-finding abilities are limited. </p> <p> Windows 10 and Windows 8 are not supported. </p> <span> Download Product Key Informer</span> 19 of 20 <h2> Game Key Revealer </h2> What We Like <p> Finds the keys for a huge variety of video games</p> <p> Lets you export the product keys to a file</p> <p> The application is 100 percent portable</p> <p> Supports changing the key for some games</p> What We Don't Like <p> Doesn t show product keys for any other kinds of software</p> <p> Hasn t been updated since 2014, so it might not support newer games</p> <p> Game Key Revealer shows the product keys of over 2000 games. </p> <p> It s completely portable, takes up very little space, and can export keys to a text file or print them off. </p> <p> <strong> Finds Keys for Games:</strong>   Half-Life, Battlefield 2, Counter-Strike, Mirror s Edge, Halo, Need for Speed, Dead Space, Crysis, Harry Potter , and many more. </p> <p> In addition to showing the product keys for a few thousand games, keys for nearly two dozen can actually be  changed  with Game Key Revealer, which could come in handy. </p> <span> Download Game Key Revealer</span> 20 of 20 <h2> Abelssoft s MyKeyFinder </h2> What We Like <p> Works in Windows 10 and older Windows versions</p> <p> Shows keys for MS Office programs and some non-Microsoft applications</p> <p> Multiple ways to save the keys</p> <p> You can find keys quickly by searching through the results</p> What We Don't Like <p> Might show keys for programs that don t use product keys</p> <p> Not all features are free; you have to pay to enable them</p> <p> Asks you to donate each time you close the software</p> <p> MyKeyFinder lets you save product keys to a PDF file or to the clipboard. You can also send one or more keys to a printer. </p> <p> You can search through the list of install keys it finds and even add registry keys to a blocklist to avoid finding serials in those locations. </p> <p> <strong> Finds Keys for Operating Systems:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 7. </p> <p> <strong> Finds Keys for Other Software:</strong>  VMware, some Microsoft Office products, and others. </p> <p> While testing MyKeyFinder, we found that a scan takes a little longer to complete than any of the other programs from this list. Also, it found keys for programs (dozens of them) that don t actually use serials, as well a key for Microsoft Office 2013 that wasn t correct. </p> <span> Download MyKeyFinder</span> <h2> <span> Important Information on Windows Product Keys </span> </h2> <p> Many computers that were purchased with Windows 10 or 8 preinstalled from the manufacturer wont have a product sticker with a license key printed on it, nor will you have a key in your documentation. </p> <p> However, it is possible to retrieve the Windows OEM license key unique to the PC from the BIOS using an offline license recovery tool . A few we like include Lazesof s tool , as well as NeoSmart s OemKey . On the other hand, if Windows 10/8 wasn t installed at the time of purchase, even these tools won t work. </p> <p> If you re reinstalling the same version and edition of Windows 10 or 8 back onto the computer after wiping it clean or replacing the hard drive, you likely do not need to find the product key at all. During installation, Windows will read the BIOS and successfully install without the need to enter a license key!</p> <p> If your system was purchased with an older version of Windows installed and you have not reinstalled it or upgraded it yourself, a key finder may only find the generic product key that your PC manufacturer used to install Windows. This product key may not work when attempting to reinstall Windows. In this case, you must use the unique product key that is on the sticker attached to your computer case. </p> <p> If you can t locate your product key sticker you ll need to request a new Windows product key . </p> More from Lifewire <span> ProduKey v1.93 Free Product Key Finder Tool Review</span> <span> Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder v2.0.10.13</span> <span> Windows Product Key Finder Pro v2.5</span> <span> LicenseCrawler v2.3</span> <span> Winkeyfinder v2.05</span> <span> Belarc Advisor v9.7 Review</span> <span> Windows Product Key Viewer v1.07</span> <span> How to Find Your Windows 7 Product Key</span> <span> 6 Best Free Windows Password Recovery Tools</span> <span> How to Find Your Windows 8 or 8.1 Product Key</span> <span> Latest Microsoft Office Service Packs</span> <span> How to Find Microsoft Windows Product Keys</span> <span> Do Windows Keygens Really Work?</span> <span> 10 Best Free System Information Tools</span> <span> How to Find Microsoft Office Product Keys</span> <span> 14 Best Free Hard Drive Testing Programs</span> Lifewire Follow Us <span> Facebook</span> News Best Products Mobile Phones Computers About Us Advertise Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Careers Editorial Guidelines Contact Terms of Use California Privacy Notice <span> Lifewire is part of the Dotdash publishing family. </span> Lifewire uses cookies to provide you with a great user experience.
